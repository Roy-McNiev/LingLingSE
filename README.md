## Background
For a long time it has been hard for classical music fans to search for classical music on any search engines. As described in a section in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgzPQCi-Xuo) made by TwoSetViolin, a prototype of this engine was carried out, which involves searching for classical music by pitch.
